Cash Register
Description

The Cash Register project is a simple web application that calculates change for a transaction. Users can input the total amount owed and the amount paid, and the application will determine the exact change to be returned, broken down into various denominations (e.g., tens, fives, ones, coins). This project was created as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification from FreeCodeCamp.

  Denomination Breakdown: Displays the change in specific denominations (e.g., $10, $5, $1 bills, and coins).
  Simple Interface: A clean, minimalistic one-page design for ease of use.
